Fabien's teaching resources
===========================

Teaching resources for Fabien's lectures.

**New:** the scientific programming lecture has its own 
[website](http://fabienmaussion.info/scientific_programming/) and
[github repository](https://github.com/fmaussion/scientific_programming).

You can have a look at the `Python installation instructions <install_python.rst>`_ if you want to
install python on your laptop, or this short `Linux tutorial <linux_tutorial.rst>`_  (for students
at the University of Innsbruck).

Current courses
---------------

- `Physics of the Climate System <https://github.com/fmaussion/teaching/tree/master/current>`_ (Master level)
